# Fundamental Algorithms

1. Sigma: Given a number, return the sum of all positive integers up to number (inclusive). (e.g, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

2. Factorial: Given a numberm return the product of all positive integers from 1 up to number (inclusive). (e,g 1 * 2 * 3 * 4)

3. Threes and Fives: Add values 100 to 4000000 (inclusive) if value is evenly distributed by 3 or 5 but not both.

4. Fizz Buzz: For each number (between 1 - 100, inclusive) divisible by three the computer will display the word “fizz”, For each number divisible by five the computer will display the word “buzz”, For each number divisible by three and by five the computer will display the word “fizz-buzz”.
