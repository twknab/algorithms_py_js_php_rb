# Fundamental Algorithms

1. Sigma: Given a number, return the sum of all positive integers up to number (inclusive). (e.g, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

2. Factorial: Given a numberm return the product of all positive integers from 1 up to number (inclusive). (e,g 1 * 2 * 3 * 4)

3. Threes and Fives: Add values 100 to 4000000 (inclusive) if value is evenly distributed by 3 or 5 but not both.

4. Fizz Buzz: For each number (between 1 - 100, inclusive) divisible by three the computer will display the word “fizz”, For each number divisible by five the computer will display the word “buzz”, For each number divisible by three and by five the computer will display the word “fizz-buzz”.

5. IsPrime: Given an integer, return whether an integer is prime or not. Prime numbers are only divisible by themselves and 1.

6. Sum to One Digit: Implement a function which given an integer, sums the integer's digits, consecutively (repeatedly, over and over again) until the sum is only one digit. Example) Given the number 928, 9 + 2 + 8 = 19; 1 + 9 = 10; 1 + 0 = 1 (return 1)

# Arrays

1. Push Front: Given an array and an additionalv alue, insert this value at the beginning of the array. Do this without any built-in methods if you can.

2. Pop Front: Return the first value at the beginning of an array.
