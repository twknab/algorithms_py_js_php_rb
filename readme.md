# Algorithms

## Fundamentals

1. Sigma: Given a number, return the sum of all positive integers up to number (inclusive). (e.g, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

2. Factorial: Given a numberm return the product of all positive integers from 1 up to number (inclusive). (e,g 1 x 2 x 3 x 4)

3. Threes and Fives: Add values 100 to 4000000 (inclusive) if value is evenly distributed by 3 or 5 but not both.

4. Fizz Buzz: For each number (between 1 - 100, inclusive) divisible by three the computer will display the word “fizz”, For each number divisible by five the computer will display the word “buzz”, For each number divisible by three and by five the computer will display the word “fizz-buzz”.

5. IsPrime: Given an integer, return whether an integer is prime or not. Prime numbers are only divisible by themselves and 1.

6. Sum to One Digit: Implement a function which given an integer, sums the integer's digits, consecutively (repeatedly, over and over again) until the sum is only one digit. Example) Given the number 928, 9 + 2 + 8 = 19; 1 + 9 = 10; 1 + 0 = 1 (return 1)

## Arrays

1. Push Front: Given an array and an additionalv alue, insert this value at the beginning of the array. Do this without any built-in methods if you can.

2. Pop Front: Return the first value at the beginning of an array.

3. Insert At: Given an array, index and additional value, insert the value into the array at given index. Do this without using built-in array methods if you can.

4. Remove At: Given an array and index of an array, remove and return the array value at that index. Do this without using any built-in methods except pop() (JS) if you can.

5. Filter Range: Given an array and values min and max, remove array values between min and max. Work in plcae, return the array you are given with the values in original order. Try not to use any built in array functions if you can.

6. Concat: Replicate javascript's concat() function. Create a function which accepts two arrays, and return a new array contianing the first array's elements followed by the second array's elements. Do not alter the original array. E.g, ['a', 'b'], [1, 2] would return a new array: ['a', 'b', 1, 2]

7. Sort: Given an array, sort it from least to greatest.

## Queues

1. Enqueue: create a method called enqueue which adds a given value to the end of our queue.

2. Front: return the front of a queues's value without removing it.

3. isEmpty(): create a method which returns wehther our queue contains no values

4. Compare queues: create a function, if given 2 queues, returns whether they are equal. They are only equal if they have elements in identical order. Don't create any other objects or alter the original queues

5. Dequeue: remove and return value at the front of a queue

6. Contains:  Size: return the number of values in the queue

7. Size: return the number of values in the queue

8. RemoveMin: remove the queues lowest value and any duplicates of that value, return the modified queue

9. Interleave Queue: interweave the first and second half of a queue

## Recursion

1. Recursive Sigma: write a function that givena  number returns the sum of integers from 1 to that number.

2. Recursive factorial: Given a number, return the product of integers from 1 up to that number.
